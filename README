This is a fork of sorts from a previous project I developed under the GitHub username ehzor.

Currently, this uses only the Viegnere Cipher to perform cipher manipulation on the text, but further possibilities will be available later.

The current modules both the server & client rely on:

Server: shadow, crypt, pthread
Client: Linux-PAM (PAM)

NOTES:

If you wish to compile this, please use the "build.sh" script included.  To build the server, use "./build.sh s", and for the client/PAM module, 
"./build.sh c"

While I cannot confirm this, I feel it is in my best interest to inform anyone who wishes to use this that as this is a C++ PAM module, it can 
possibly cause conflicts with other modules.  I myself have not had any issues during testing with various modules for login enabled at once, but 
mangling C & C++ modules could always have some unexpected consequences.  While I will do my best to provide support for this program, Linux machines 
are natorious for being different from another, so my support will be as best it can be.  I also offer this module and server as-is, and take no 
responsibility for any damages, direct or indirect.
