This is a fork of sorts from a previous project I developed under the GitHub username ehzor.

Currently, this uses only the Viegnere Cipher to perform cipher manipulation on the text, but further possibilities will be available later.

The current modules both the server & client rely on:

Server: crypt, pthread
Client: Linux-PAM (PAM)

USAGE:

Server - Must be ran as root, as it requires access to /etc/shadow for authentication means.  Writes both successful and failure messages to syslog (/var/log/auth.log by default).
Client - Add the following line to any of the /etc/pam.d/* files:
auth sufficient pam_zorpher.so

Please note that "sufficient" can be replaced with "optional" (if authentication with Zorpher fails continue on, similar to "sufficient"), "requisite" meaning that its part of a chain of log in steps, or "required" meaning that if the user doesn't enter the correct information, then they are denied access.

It is wise to have either "sufficient" or "optional" in place until you are satisfied with the results.

OPTIONS:

The PAM module (client) now has the following options available, which can be placed at the end of the line in any of the /etc/pam.d/* files it is in:
server=### - Either server hostname (FQDN) or IP address (i.e.: server=auth.example.com or server=200.12.48.5).  This tells the module what computer has the Zorpher server installed
port=### - The port number that the server is listening on.

In the next release, the same options (and more) will be available in the server.

NOTES:

If you wish to compile this, please use the "build.sh" script included.  To build the server, use "./build.sh s", and for the client/PAM module, "./build.sh c"

While I cannot confirm this, I feel it is in my best interest to inform anyone who wishes to use this that as this is a C++ PAM module, it can possibly cause conflicts with other modules.  I myself have not had any issues during testing with various modules for login enabled at once, but mangling C & C++ modules could always have some unexpected consequences.  While I will do my best to provide support for this program, Linux machines are natorious for being different from another, so my support will be as best it can be.  I also offer this module and server as-is, and take no responsibility for any damages, direct or indirect.
