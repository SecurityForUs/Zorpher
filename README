This is a fork of sorts from a previous project I developed under the GitHub username ehzor.

Currently, this uses only the Viegnere Cipher to perform cipher manipulation on the text, but further possibilities will be available later.

The current modules both the server & client rely on:

Server: shadow, crypt, pthread
Client: N/A

NOTES:

Currently, this program does not install as a PAM module, but is compiled as two binaries.
If you wish to compile this, run the "build.sh" file for one quick motion.
